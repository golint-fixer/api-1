build api
=========
Just a build API.

### go
To get this API up and running, execute the following to make sure you have all needed deps:

```bash
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide # Get the glide dep management tool.
glide install # Install our API's deps.
```

Now just boot the API for development:

```bash
go run main.go
```
